# Third-party notices

HaulNX is distributed with, or links against, the following third-party
components. Their license notices are reproduced here as required.

HaulNX as a whole is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3
or later (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and
[`licenses/GPL-3.0.txt`](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt)), because it incorporates
LGPLv3 code (unarr) and follows the pattern of an Apache-2.0 reference
(cmtp-responder), both below. The other components listed here are under
GPL-compatible licenses.

---

## unarr

The native RAR3 filter-decoder fallback under `source/rar3/` and
`include/rar3.h` ports the relevant slice of **unarr**
(https://github.com/zeniko/unarr, upstream commit `d1be8c43a8`) — the base
RAR3 archive/header parsing, Huffman and LZSS+range decompression, and the
fingerprint-matched native filter functions (delta/E8/RGB/audio), with the
general-purpose filter bytecode interpreter deliberately removed (see
`include/rar3.h` for why). Ported files retain unarr's own file-level
copyright header.

unarr is licensed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3**.
Because that code is incorporated into and distributed as part of HaulNX, the
combined work is covered by the GPLv3 (LGPLv3 §4 permits this: conveying the
combination under the GPL). The full license text is bundled at
[`licenses/LGPL-3.0.txt`](licenses/LGPL-3.0.txt).

unarr's own `AUTHORS` file additionally credits The Unarchiver project
(https://code.google.com/p/theunarchiver/) and Simon Bünzli, and notes that
`common/crc32.c` and the `lzmasdk/` sources it depends on (both carried
forward unmodified here) are Public Domain.

## cmtp-responder

The embedded USB MTP responder's protocol/command layer under `include/mtp/`
and `source/mtp/` follows the container-framing and per-operation dispatch
pattern used by **cmtp-responder**
(https://github.com/cmtp-responder/cmtp-responder) — a permissively-licensed,
platform-generic MTP responder (forked from Tizen's `mtp-responder` by
Collabora specifically to depend only on generic libraries). Its protocol
layer is cleanly separated from its own Linux FunctionFS transport, which is
what makes it usable as a layout reference without pulling in anything
platform-specific; the USB transport in `source/mtp/usb_session.cpp` here is
written fresh against libnx's own `usbds` API instead.

cmtp-responder is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**.

## Noto Sans (subset)

`romfs/fonts/viet-fallback.ttf` is a modified glyph subset of **Noto Sans
Regular** (Latin Extended Additional + combining diacritics, used as a

subset to the listed ranges, vertical metrics matched to the console's system
font for baseline alignment, and renamed to "Viet Fallback Sans" per the OFL's

## switch-hbas-repo (app/emulator catalog data)

`romfs/update_sources.json` — the bundled catalog the on-device update manager
(see the `[[ondevice-update-manager]]` project note) uses to know each app's
GitHub repo — was expanded using package metadata from **fortheusers'
switch-hbas-repo** (https://github.com/fortheusers/switch-hbas-repo), which
backs the community's hb-app.store index. Only the repo-ownership metadata
(each package's `pkgbuild.json`, cross-checked against its actual
`releases/download/` asset URL) was used to identify which GitHub repo each
app's updates come from; HaulNX always resolves and downloads the update
itself directly from GitHub Releases, never from hb-app.store's own hosting.
